A very poor man lived in a small village. Despite his poverty, he was rich in kindness and generosity. Every day, he shared what little he had with his neighbors, believing that true wealth was measured by the love and goodwill one had for others. His humble acts inspired the entire village, and he became a beacon of hope and community spirit.
